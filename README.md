# Asteroids Game

A simple, fun video game inspired by the classic **Asteroids** game. This project was developed as part of the **Boot.dev** learning path, focusing on multi-file Python projects and object-oriented programming.

## 🎯 Project Goals

The primary learning objectives of this project are:
- Gain experience with multi-file Python projects.
- Understand real-world applications of object-oriented programming.
- Enjoy building a rewarding project while learning!

## 🚀 Features

- **Classic Asteroids Gameplay**: Navigate a spaceship, avoid asteroids, and test your reflexes.
- **Physics Simulation**: Enjoy smooth gameplay with basic physics for movement and collisions.
- **Python-Powered**: Built entirely in Python using the **Pygame** library.

## 🛠 Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have:
- **Python 3.10+** installed on your machine.
- Access to a Unix-like shell (e.g., zsh or bash).

## 🧰 Installation

Follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Bayashat/Asteroids.git
    cd Asteroids
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
    
    venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## ▶️ How to Play

1. Run the game:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. Use your keyboard to control the spaceship:
   - **W A S D**: Move the spaceship.
   - **Spacebar**: Shoot asteroids.

3. Avoid collisions with asteroids while shooting them down!


## 🎓 Learning Highlights

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes and objects were used to represent game entities like the player and asteroids.
- **Multi-File Organization**: The project is modular, with separate files for each functionality.
- **Physics and Graphics**: Basic physics for movement and collision detection combined with Pygame for rendering.
